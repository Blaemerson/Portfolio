## Who I Am

I'm a programmer! :^)

*When I'm not programming*, I enjoy the outdoors, literature, and exploring new
technologies.

## What I Do

As a Software Engineer, I seek to build and maintain complex, multi-faceted applications. 
In addition to my experience as a software developer and engineer, my peers know me for 
facing new challenges with enthusiasm and a strong commitment to learn.

At any given time, I may be working on a number of side projects (this site is one of them!)

## What I Know

The following is a list of technologies I consider myself proficient in:

* **Java**: I developed several applications using Java and have developed a love-hate
  relationship with the language (mostly love though <3)
* **Typescript** + **ReactJS**: The tools I used to make this website! In addition to
  these major tools, I also used NextJS, TRPC, and Prisma to get things up and running.
  See the projects **Github page** to learn more.
